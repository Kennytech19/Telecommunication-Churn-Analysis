# Telecommunication-Churn-Analysis
Churn is the measure of how many customers stop using a product or service. Telecommunication churn is the measure of how many customers stop using the product or service of a telecommunication company.

Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concerns for large companies. Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies, especially in the telecom field, companies are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn. Companies are working hard to survive in this competitive market depending on multiple strategies. Therefore, finding factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn. Churn can be avoided by studying the past history of customers

The aim of this project is to carry out a complete EDA process to determine factors that increase customer churn. Also, I will draw some insights from data visualization and analysis so that I could get the factors which affect the churn of the customer.
